## Project structure
The purpose of each folder in the project tree is the following:
1. `/app`
    - `/models`: SQLModel Python representation of the database tables.
    - `/routes`: Routes for accessing the api (auth, admin, student, etc).
    - `/serializers`: Models/Schemas to handle the request/response bodies.
    - `/core`: Utility functions related to security, dependencies and whatnot.
2. `/database`: Schematic of DB in picture and dbdiagram.io code


## Running locally
```text
> Change ".env.example" filename to ".env" and fill in what is needed(DB and SMTP credentials)
> Now, all you need to do is run script in powershell "run.ps1". 
It will create a virtual enviorment, download all depedencies and start server :D

Tested on:
> Python: 3.12.10
> PostgreSQL: 18.1

tip: You can access the auto-generated docs through http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
It show full list of endpoints and payloads (genuinely useful)
```

## Database structure

#### DB Schematic
![alt text](/database/database.png)

#### DB legend
1. `users`: All users (Student/Admin(Starosta)). The role defines permissions.

2. `invitations`: Invitation codes generated by the Admin (for students) or by a script (for the Admin).

3. `auth_tokens`: “Magic links” for logging in (one-time use).

4. `registration_campaigns`: Registration Campaigns opened by the Admin (e.g., “Rekrutacja zima 2026”).

5. `registration_groups`: Specific subjects/slots within the campaign (e.g., “DevOps gr. 1”).

6. `registrations`: Connection between the Student and the Group (registration request). The student's preferences are saved here.
